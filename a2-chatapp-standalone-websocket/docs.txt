Before brokers like Kafka, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ:

Chat apps did NOT need brokers.

They were direct TCP server-client apps, or browser-based with HTTP polling.

WebSocket came later, to make real-time browser chat possible.

Kafka and brokers are for scaling and persistence, not required for simple chat.
